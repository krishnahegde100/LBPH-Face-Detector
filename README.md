# LBPH-Face-Detector
Local Binary Pattern Histogram technique was used to build a face detector from scratch without any inbuilt library. Using the LBPH algorithm, histogram of features of a large dataset was created. As a result, were able to identify a given image by converting it into a histogram and matching it with a dataset histogram via a sophisticated distance method.
